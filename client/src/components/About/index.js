                When I was layed off from my job at AT&T working as a phone operator
                I needed something to fill the time while disabilty would start and I began
                experimenting making Barbeque Sauce. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                First was the original flavor and I
                spent a few years perfecting the recipe 
                into what it is today.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                After we needed something with more sweetness to it.
                So along came the idea of adding Honey to the recipe.
                It was an instant hit! It added the much needed sweetness
                and smokey combination.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Soon later we were asked about spicy sauce. We never experimented
                with spice before so we wanted the challenge!
                We came up with the Chipotle recipe to give that spice kick but still
                keep the overall smokey flavor associated with Powers Family
                Barebeque Sauce.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                We eventually learned one of the creators was allergic to some spice
                we used in the sauce. We took out all the spices and replaced it
                with a Pineapple flavor giving it a sweetness and spiceless flavor
                that works perfect with pork!
